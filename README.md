# UFOs

## Summary ##
Although some of us left concerns about UFO sightings in the 1990s where they belong, others among us are hypervigilant. In this project, I collected background information and data about UFO sightings and created a webpage with these findings. While the reporters chose to remain anonymous, details about the location of the sighting, shape of the figure, and other comments are outlined on the page. Users can filter this data to research reports in specific locations, on specific days, and with specific shapes.

## Analysis ##

Here's how to use the page. When you first open the webpage, you will see the landing page with all data clearly visible.

To target specific information, simply input data in the required formats into their respective search boxes. In this example, I look for sightings on 1/9/2010.

You can add as much or as little data as you choose, but keep in mind that the more data you enter, the less likely you may find data to match your search.

## Results ##

Although I like the webpage I designed, I would reconsider certain design elements if I recreated this page. First, I think users expect a button that confirms their search criteria. Even though my page is already responsive, the UX of the page would be improved by a search button.

If I were this webpage's user, I would recommend two additions. I would recommend removing the "UFO Sightings" homerow at the top and replacing it with a Menu option. I would also recommend linking data to individual pages within this website where a user could continue their research about a specific sighting. 

But as it stands, this project's aim was to display this information in an interactive way, so it achieves its main purpose.
